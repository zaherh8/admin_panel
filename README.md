# Admin Panel
An admin panel to manage employees built with ``node.js`` and ``React.js``.

## For development purposes

You would need to create your own .env file with the following content

In order to run the project (both client and server), run the following command:

``cd admin_server and npm run dev`` you will have both projects running concurrently.

## The front end
The frond end is written in ``React.js`` and rely on a one react libraries that works perfectly for admin templates and supports CRUD operations, pagination, filtering and sorting. 

Simple, fast and optimized that's why I went with this choice. Fast to integrate which is great for someone who does not have a lot of experience on the front end tools.

## The back end

The back end is written in ``Node.js``. 
It supports a REST API to manage the employees.
Relies on env variable so it can be launched in any environemnt.
